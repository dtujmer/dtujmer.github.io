# Test blog post

“This is what I do for everything I post:
Write all of my thoughts on a subject.
Argue against those ideas.
Explore different angles until I’m sick of it.
Leave it for a few days or years, then repeat those steps.
Hate how messy these thoughts have become.
Reduce them to a tiny outline of the key points.
Post the outline. Trash the rest.” - Derek Sivers, “My writing process”
